## Routes Implemented

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Home route | Welcome message |

| GET | `/time` | Time route | Current date and time in JSON format |
| GET | Any undefined route | Not-found handler | HTTP 404 response |

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Install Node.js and npm on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saicharan-9151/Module-1-Lab-1.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd Module-1-Lab-1
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run at:

`http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Routes

Open the following addresses in your browser after starting the server:

- Home: `http://localhost:3000/`
- About: `http://localhost:3000/about`
- Time: `http://localhost:3000/time`
- Not found: `http://localhost:3000/unknown`

## Screenshots

## Result

The Express server was implemented and tested successfully. The application handles the home, about, and time routes and returns an appropriate HTTP 404 response for undefined routes.
